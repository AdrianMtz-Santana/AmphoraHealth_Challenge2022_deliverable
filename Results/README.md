## PCA ordination 

- The AFR and EAS populations where the ones that grouped the most.

- Values of the first three componentes. First one explaines more than 75% of the variance.

## With an Identity-By-State Analysis and MDS results are almost the same

This shows that observed groups have consistency across different ordinations.

 ## Whats going on with the samples with no population ID?
 - How many groups are between samples
 -
 ![Plot4](https://github.com/AdrianMtz-Santana/AmphoraHealth_Bioinformatic_Challenge2022_deliverable/blob/main/Results/Plot_groups.png)


It seems that
 - Group 2 resembles AFR 
 - Group 3 resembles EAS
 - Group 4 resembles AMR
 - Group 5 resembles SAS
 - Group 6 resembles EUR
 - Group 1 some samples between 2 and 4/6 (many of this samples are close to the center
 
 Althhough 4 and 5 an are not well defined clusters.
